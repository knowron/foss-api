## üóíÔ∏è Introduction

This repo defines a [serverless function](https://github.com/knowron/foss-api/blob/main/src/extraction.py) for PDF content extraction via [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The function is currently implemented as an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/resources/) function deployed as a Docker container.

## üñ•Ô∏è Local Development

For local development and testing, you can run this Lambda function as a FastAPI server:

### Quick Start

1. **Configure AWS credentials**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your AWS credentials and S3 bucket names
   ```

2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python run_locally.py
   ```

3. **Test the API**:
   ```bash
   python test_local_api.py
   ```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /extract` - Extract text from PDF (FastAPI format)
- `POST /extract-lambda` - Extract text from PDF (Lambda event format)
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /config` - Configuration info

See [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## üèóÔ∏è Setting things up

<sup>Note: The following steps apply only to AWS.</sup>

First, the function has to be dockerized and pushed to [Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html). Thus, create an ECR repository and follow the steps displayed on the AWS Console when clicking on "View push commands" (replace `latest` by the appropriate version). With that, you'll have your Docker image built, pushed, and ready to be consumed by AWS Lambda.

Then, from AWS Lambda, set up a new function and specify the image pushed previously to ECR.

## üîó Dependencies

This project uses **[`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) to
handle dependencies.** Therefore, the only time you'll need to use `pip` should
be to install `pipenv` itself:

```console
pip install pipenv
```

<br>

Then, to **install the project dependencies**, simply run:

```console
pipenv install
```

<br>

#### ü§ñ Other `pipenv` commands

To **install a Python module**, simply run:

```console
pipenv install package
```

or to **install a specific version**:

```console
pipenv install package==0.5
```

<br>

To **update all dependencies**:

```console
pipenv update
```

<br>

If you've updated any dependencies, **don't forget to recreate the `requirements.txt` file**:
```console
pipenv requirements > requirements.txt
```

<br>

To **activate the virtual environment**:

```console
pipenv shell
```

<br>

docs](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html).
